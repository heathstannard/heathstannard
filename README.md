Hello! I'm @heathstannard 👋

I've been a Drupal developer for many years, starting around 2006. I am an Acquia Triple Certified Drupal Expert, currently working for [Digital Convergence](https://digitalconvergence.ca).

Recently I've been interested in frontend frameworks - experimenting with many but concentrating mainly on Vue.js.

I run a Fantasy Hockey 🏒 platform that utilises 2 technologies mentioned above - Drupal & Vue.js. [Mighty Pucks](https://www.mightypucks.com)

I am originally from New Zealand 🇳🇿, now based in Quebec, Canada 🇨🇦.
