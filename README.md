Hello! I'm @heathstannard 👋

I've been a Drupal developer for many years, starting around 2006. I was certified by Acquia as Drupal Triple Certified. I'm always open to short/medium term Drupal contracts.

Recently I've been interested in frontend frameworks - experimenting with many but concentrating mainly on Vue.js. I'm also about to get started creating my first Android/iOS app.

Currently I'm working on a Fantasy Hockey 🏒 platform that utilises 2 technologies mentioned above - Drupal & Vue.js. It's in a testing phase and should be launching for the 2022/23 hockey season.

I am originally from New Zealand 🇳🇿 and am now based in Quebec, Canada 🇨🇦.
